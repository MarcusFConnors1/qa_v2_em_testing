Okididilly, I think that the "Searching Narrows the list" test has a weird part being .toBeGreaterThanOrEqual, as that I think
could create false positives. As far as I can think about this it seems that there is no reason for the OrEqual part to be 
included in that assertion. I don't know, maybe I'm crazy but it just seems like it does not offer anything more than another
variable that could go wrong. 
I would also think that it would be a good idea to search for more than one item, as you would most likely do that anyways
with manual testing.
It seems like it could miss potential bugs as well as it does not look at what is being searched, meaning that the search
could be completely broken but if the list is shorter than the original it would still pass.
I think that I would alter the test to include some way to make sure of what is being search, making sure that all results include what is being searched 
for. I would also add more than one thing that is being searched for, as that is what I would do if I were to test it manually.
Regarding the "Can add and delete an employee" test, I would also add more than one test. I think that that test is pretty 
solid otherwise, to me it seems to to what it is supposed to do.

** I implemented the changes mentioned above into the code on emv2.test.ts
